**Dysarthric Speech Detection Using Binary Detection Techniques on the TORGO Dataset**

  This project aims to analyze the performance of various binary detection techniques for detecting dysarthric speech using the TORGO dysarthric speech dataset. The goal is to implement and compare both traditional and advanced detection algorithms to evaluate their effectiveness in distinguishing between dysarthric and non-dysarthric speech samples.

**TORGO Dysarthric Speech Dataset**

  The TORGO dataset consists of speech samples from individuals with dysarthria, a motor speech disorder caused by neurological conditions. Dysarthria affects speech intelligibility, making its detection a challenging yet vital task in speech recognition systems. The dataset provides a diverse range of speech recordings, presenting unique challenges for automatic speech detection models.

**Key Objectives**

Analyze and Implement Binary Detection Techniques:

**Traditional Techniques:** 

Implement and evaluate traditional detection algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and their hybrid combinations to classify dysarthric vs. non-dysarthric speech.

**Advanced Techniques:** 
    Contrastive Learning
    Knowledge Graphs
    Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, Wav2Vec)
    Self-Supervised Learning models (e.g., HuBERT, BYOL)
    Graph Neural Networks (e.g., TKMGNN)
    
**Performance Comparison:**
Evaluate each technique using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and computational efficiency.
Prepare a comparative analysis to determine the best-performing model for this particular dataset and task.

This project offers an in-depth exploration of speech detection models, providing a solid foundation for addressing dysarthria in speech recognition systems.
